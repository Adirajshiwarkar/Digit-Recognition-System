# Digit Identification System using Neural Networks

A beginner-friendly digit classification project using TensorFlow and Keras to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. This project illustrates the process of building and training a simple neural network model from scratch.

---

## 🔖 Overview

This project demonstrates a deep learning approach for recognizing handwritten digits (0–9) using a fully connected neural network (FCNN). The model is trained on the widely-used MNIST dataset containing thousands of labeled digit images.

## 🚧 Installation

Install all the required packages before running the script:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

---

## 📊 Dataset

**MNIST Dataset** from Keras:

* 60,000 training images
* 10,000 testing images
* Each image is 28x28 pixels in grayscale

---

## 🔬 How It Works

### 1. Data Loading

```python
(xtrain, ytrain), (xtest, ytest) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
```

### 2. Preprocessing

* Normalize pixel values by dividing by 255
* Reshape 28x28 images into 784-dimensional vectors

```python
xtrain = xtrain / 255
xtest = xtest / 255
xtrain = xtrain.reshape(-1, 784)
xtest = xtest.reshape(-1, 784)
```

### 3. Model Architecture

```python
model = keras.Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_dim=784))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='softmax'))
```

### 4. Compilation and Training

```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(xtrain, ytrain, epochs=5)
```

### 5. Prediction

```python
ans = model.predict(xtest)
print(np.argmax(ans[0]))  # Predicted digit
```

---

## 📊 Visualization Example

```python
plt.matshow(xtest[0])
```

This displays the grayscale image of a handwritten digit.

## ✨ Possible Improvements

* Integrate CNNs for improved accuracy
* Add Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
* Build a GUI using Streamlit or Gradio
* Evaluate with confusion matrix and other metrics
